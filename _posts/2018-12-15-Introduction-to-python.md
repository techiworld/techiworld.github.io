## Python History

- Python was developed by **_Guido Van Rossum_** at National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in Netherlands during 1985-1990
- Python is derived from many other languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, C++, Algol-68, SmallTalk, Unix shell and other scripting languages.
- Rossum was inspired from " Monty Python's Flying Circus", a BBC comedy series and he wanted the name of his new language to be short, unique and mysterious. Hence he named it Python.
- It was a general-purpose **interpreted**, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language.
- _Python source code is available under the GNU General Public License(GPL)_ and it is now maintained by a core development team at the National Research Institute.

## Python Philosophy

Python’s philosophy has always been to make code readable and accessible. That philosophy has been summed up in Python’s **"PEP 20 (The Zen Of Python)"** document, which reads as follows:

{% include MyNote.html note_type="success" span_note="Python Phylosophy"
text="<br />Beautiful is better than ugly.<br />
Explicit is better than implicit.<br />
Simple is better than complex.<br />
Complex is better than complicated.<br />
Flat is better than nested.<br />
Sparse is better than dense.<br />
Readability counts.<br />
Special cases aren’t special enough to break the rules.<br />
Although practicality beats purity.<br>
Errors should never pass silently.<br />
Unless explicitly silenced.<br />
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.<br />
There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it.<br />
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you’re Dutch.<br />
Now is better than never.<br />
Although never is often better than right now.<br />
If the implementation is hard to explain, it’s a bad idea.<br />
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.<br />
Namespaces are one honking great idea—let’s do more of those!" %}

- EVE Online, a massively multiplayer online game (MMOG) by CCP Games, uses Python broadly.
- The widespread BitTorrent peer-to-peer file sharing system began its life as a Python program.
- Industrial Light & Magic, Pixar, and others use Python in the production of animated movies.
- ESRI uses Python as an end-user customization tool for its popular GIS mapping products.
- Google’s App Engine web development framework uses Python as an application language.
- The IronPort email server product uses more than 1 million lines of Python code to do its job.
- Maya, a powerful integrated 3D modeling and animation system, provides a Python scripting API.
- The NSA uses Python for cryptography and intelligence analysis.
- iRobot uses Python to develop commercial and military robotic devices.
- The Civilization IV game’s customizable scripted events are written entirely in Python.
- The One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) project built its user interface and activity model in Python.
- Netflix and Yelp have both documented the role of Python in their software infrastructures.
- Intel, Cisco, Hewlett-Packard, Seagate, Qualcomm, and IBM use Python for hardware testing.

## Features of Python
1. **Python is free** – is open source distributable software
2. **Python is easy to learn** – has a simple language syntax
3. **Python is easy to read** – is uncluttered by punctuation
4. **Python is easy to maintain** – is modular for simplicity
5. **Python is “batteries included”** – provides a large standard library for easy integration into your own programs
6. **Python is interactive** – has a terminal for debugging and testing snippets of code
7. **Python is portable**– runs on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms
8. **Python is interpreted** – there is no compilation required
9. **Python is high-level** – has automatic memory management
10. **Python is extensible** – allows the addition of low-level modules to the interpreter for customization
11. **Python is versatile** – supports both procedure-orientated programming and object-orientated programming (OOP)
12. **Python is flexible** – can create console programs, windowed GUI (Graphical User Interface) applications, and CGI (Common Gateway Interface) scripts to process web data
